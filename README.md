# Asset allocation calculator

This is a script that calculates monthly allocation percentages for a given list of assets and a given list of initial allocation percentages for each asset using a quantitative approach.

Developed and tested in Linux, using Python 3.8.0.

## Setting up the project

Initially, clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/inaciomdrs/Asset-Allocation-Calculator.git
$ cd Asset-Allocation-Calculator
```

Then, enter in the downloaded directory and create and activate a python virtualenv:

```bash
$ python -m venv .asset_allocation
$ source .asset_allocation/bin/activate
```

Next, install the project requirements:

```bash
(.asset_allocation) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are ready to run the script!

## Usage

Once you have set up the project, you can run using one of the following commands:

```bash
(.asset_allocation) $ python asset_allocation_calculator.py <list_of_assets>
```

Or 

```bash
(.asset_allocation) $ python asset_allocation_calculator.py <list_of_assets> --perc <list_of_percentages>
```

Where `<list_of_assets>` must be a list of valid tickers for [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/). 

If `<list_of_percentages>` is not passed, the script will assume equal initial percentages for each asset.

### Usage example


Suppose you have a plan of allocating half of your investment capital in the [IVV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239726/ishares-core-sp-500-etf) ETF and the other half in the [EWL](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239685/ishares-msci-switzerland-capped-etf) ETF. To calculate which percentage of your investment capital should be spent in each ETF, run the command below. If the summation of percentages destined to IVV and EWL is not 100%, the rest is directed to Fixed Income. In the output below, each line is a month, and each column is the capital percentage to be allocated in each asset.


```bash
$ python asset_allocation_calculator.py IVV EWL
